        While creating the metadata for this book, I focused on documenting both the color charts and Werner’s physical descriptions of each color and how he conceived the colors. Each row contains the page numbers of the digitized version of the text on Colenda, as the book did not contain printed page numbers on each page. I noticed that some of the pages were out of order, missing, or duplicated in the digitized version, leading me to decide to use the digitized page numbers to keep everything consistent. However, I recorded the printed page numbers where possible and seen. The main metadata focused on the central idea of the book, which is the classification and characterization of colors. For the pages selected, I randomly chose two colors from the color chart and recorded Werner’s observations, descriptions, and corresponding natural examples. For the pages that contained how Werner created the colors, I recorded the descriptions of the colors I selected from the chart to display how Werner first described the natural aspects of the color, then how to create the color. Since this book contained over 100 colors, I chose to display two from most of the categories in an attempt to display what the book contained. I included the introduction page to give readers an idea of why the book was written, and the end page for completeness.
