        While creating the metadata for this book, I focused on documenting both the color charts and Werner’s physical descriptions of each color and how he conceived the colors. Each row contains the page numbers of the digitized version of the text on Colenda, as the book did not contain printed page numbers on each page. I noticed that some of the pages were out of order, missing, or duplicated in the digitized version, leading me to decide to use the digitized page numbers to keep everything consistent. However, I recorded the printed page numbers where possible and seen. The main metadata focused on the central idea of the book, which is the classification and characterization of colors. For the pages selected, I randomly chose two colors from the color chart and recorded Werner’s observations, descriptions, and corresponding natural examples. For the pages that contained how Werner created the colors, I recorded the descriptions of the colors I selected from the chart to display how Werner first described the natural aspects of the color, then how to create the color. Since this book contained over 100 colors, I chose to display two from most of the categories in an attempt to display what the book contained. I included the introduction page to give readers an idea of why the book was written, and the end page for completeness.

        Whilst doing this assignment, it made me realize the amount of labor that goes into producing works for the digital humanities. A “quick and dirty” OCR is not enough, as I have discovered, and more time and labor is put into things like hand-transcrption and cleaning of the OCR. If accuracy is of concern, the labor should fall onto that come from large institutions and/or scholars who study and work with digital collections. I think educational institutions should fund for the pay and proper training for those doing this work. 
HCR for my text was around 50% accurate and OCR was not very accurate at all and I spend a lot of time correcting the outputs from both technologies. Since half of my text is in chart format, when I ran the image through Tesseract, it was able to generate the text mostly correct, but due to the text being organized into a chart, the words were either completely out of order or cut off by other words or spaces. To handle the fact I would lose the chart format when converting the text to the txt file, I first typed out the header of the chart and separated the categories by using the vertical bar symbol. Then for the subsequent contents of the chart, I typed out (or copy and pasted the words that were not jumbled) in the appropriate order and separated using the vertical bar symbol. For example, the chart headings were in the order as follows: number (Named as No by the book), colours, animal, vegetable, and mineral so the order in the txt file looks like number | colours | animal | vegetable | mineral. The following lines after follow this format and the text in each respective box is put into it. In some cases there were annotations to the side of the chart so I inserted these annotations either before the main line of text or after depending on the side the annotation was. There was also extensive annotations below the charts, of which I used HTR to convert to text. HTR for the most part was accurate when I used Transkribus, however, sometimes Transkribus could not read text that was lighter than usual so I used ChatGPT in those instances. For the following pages after the charts, OCR did a well enough job that I only had to fix very punctuation errors. However, a pattern I noticed for HCR was the fact it kept misreading the endings -eus, -eon, and letters of F, P, R, S. This is likely because the handwriting was also in fancy cursive and I also struggled to decipher the text myself to correct the awkward spellings.
